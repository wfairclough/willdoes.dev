I have been doing software development professionally for the past 13 years. I consider myself a polyglot as I have utilized many different programming languages over my career and I always enjoy learning new ones. I have extended knowledge about the web platform and can be productive using many different frameworks. I also have strong mobile development skills with native iOS and Android (AOSP). Completed an advanced diploma in Photonics Engineering technology from Algonquin College as well as studied Computer Science part-time from Carleton University.

With 13 years of professional experience in software development, I pride myself on being a true polyglot, having mastered a diverse range of programming languages and always being eager to embrace new ones. My expertise spans the web platform, where I excel in multiple frameworks, and have also done significant mobile development for both native iOS and Android (AOSP). I hold an advanced diploma in Photonics Engineering Technology from Algonquin College and furthered my education with part-time studies in Computer Science at Carleton University.
